           <p>Where did you get those lovely eyes?
This pretty lady
And that exciting, winsome smile?
This binibini

Where did you learn to move like
Like graceful palm trees in the breeze?
What magic does she have?
What miracle is this?

Who wouldn't love the way her skin is kissed
By golden sunlight?
This fascinating gem so rare
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She's the perfect symbol of the people
Rich in heritage and love
What a lovely, pretty, captivating, so exciting
These girls will surely win your heart

Binibining Pilipinas, oh-oh-oh
Oh, Binibining Pilipinas, oh-oh-oh
Oh, Binibining Pilipinas, oh-oh-oh
Oh, Binibining Pilipinas, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Nakakahumaling na ngiting
Kasama ng nakakatunaw na tingin
'Di nga malayong ikaw ay hulog ni Bathala
'Pag ika'y kumaway, natutulala na
Ang eleganteng kilos mo
The way you work that thing, Diyos ko
Malapit na kitang maging gusto
Parang gusto ko na ngang maging irog mo, ha

Where did you learn to move
Like graceful palm trees in the breeze?
What magic does she have?
What miracle is this?

Binibining nakabibighani
Parang ako'y nakangiti palagi
'Pag ika'y nandiyan, walang paglagyan
Ang pananabik sa 'yo sa tuwing babati
Chills everytime you greet us
Can you feel that spark between us?
That smile can fill arenas
